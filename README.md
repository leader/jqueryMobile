This project implements a Sample Mockup in jQueryMobile with Responsive Design

The Sample Mockup page consists of 

-- Header with Logo and two ad blocks
-- Navigation with 5 buttons
-- Content with 3 equal sized columns
-- A gallery feed fetching images with different heights from a JSONP URL and displaying them in tiles without any gaps/padding/margins. (Involves Javascript)

--The Mockup file is mockup.png
-- The jQueryMobile with Responsive Design is in jquerymobile.html & jmobilecss3.css
-- The WebApp Mobile Design is in mobiledesign.html & mobiledesign.css

The jQueryMobile and Responsive design has been implemented using the existing HTML5 & CSS3 code @ https://github.com/leader/html5css3 as the base code.

jQueryMobile

-- It uses the stable version of the jQueryMobile Framework V1.2 http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/
-- It makes use of the Page, Tool Bars, Buttons, List views and applies some content formatting 
-- data-role=page, header, navbar, ui-grid-b, footer

Responsive Design

-- Media Queries have been used (optimal for Apple iOS Devices, because a Fanboy doesn't have any other devices ;)
